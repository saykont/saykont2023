# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Did Your Elementary School Science Teachers Fail You? 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that tests your scientific knowledge given questions from grades 1-5 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Like the gameshow Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader, we will prompt the user to pick a category of their choice by having them input one of 8 catergories. We will then have the program give the user a random question from that category with answer choices a-d. The user then has to input their answer choice to the question. If the user is correct, the program will reward the user with however many points that category is worth. Similar to the gameshow, first grade questions are $1,000 , second grade questions are $2,000 , third grade questions are $3,000 and fourth grade questions are worth $4,000. If the user gets the question wrong, they will lose that amount of money for their selected category. If the user does not know the answer and wants the computer to save them, they can input the word "save". Like the gameshow, the 5th graders that are attempting to save them do not always get the question correct when the player gets it wrong. As a result, we will make the computer save or not save the player at random. When the user gets to the 5th grade question, they have the option to walk away with what they have or answer 5th grade question for all (a $100,000 prize) or nothing. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Rosselinne Nunez and Assiatusow Kamara 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome/what we will accomplish is having our idea finalized, having our research done, and laying out our plan in the computer program using hashmarks. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome/what we think we can accomplish would be to be halfway or a little more than halway done with the code with no errors from the program

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to finish the project before the deadline as well as being able to have our peers successfully play the game before it is time to present it. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Since we are a group of 3, we questioned if splitting up writing the code would be a good idea but we decided to all work on it togehter. Before we start writing the code, we would definitely have to review how to write code for when we want the program to generate random actions (questions, save/not save, etc), write if/else/elif statements, and write input statements. These are topics that we have already learned how to do and more information on these topics can be found on canvas and Runestone. Along the way, if there are any other coding topics that we will have to use, we will do some research and confirm with our professor.
